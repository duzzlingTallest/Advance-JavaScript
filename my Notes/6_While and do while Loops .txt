			---------------------- While Loops And do while Loops ----------------------

	--> The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

Syntax :-
	while (condition) {
  		// code block to be executed
	}


NOTE :- 

	--> if the conditon never become FALSE, the loop will never end and this might CRASH the runtime. 


					---------------- do while loop ----------------
	--> 	The do while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the 	condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

Syntax :-
	do {
	  // code block to be executed
	}
	while (condition);
