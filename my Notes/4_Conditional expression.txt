				-----------------------Conditional Expression-----------------------

	==> A conditional expression is an expression you can use to select one of two values based on a Boolean condition.	


	=> if
	=> if else
	=> else if    


e.x =>

let a = prompt("Hey what you age ?")  // prompt make a string 
a = Number.parseInt(a) // This is a type casting .converting a string to a number

if (a<0) {
    alert("This is an invalid age..")
}

else if (a<9) {
    alert("You are a kid you can not think of driving ..")
}

else if (a<18 && a>=9) {
    alert("You are a kid you can think of driving after 18..")
}

else{
    alert("YOU CAN DRIVE ABOVE AGE 18...")
}


				-----------------------Ternary Operator-----------------------

	
				console.log("you can",(a<18? "not drive" : "drive"));

The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as an alternative to an if...else statement.
