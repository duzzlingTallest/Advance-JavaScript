	2. For in Loops
	3. For of Loops

1.For Loops :- 
	Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
		
	for (Statement 1; Statement 2; Statement 3) {
 		 // code block to be executed
	}

	Statement 1 :- is executed one time.

	Statement 2 :- defines the condition for executing the code block.

	Statement 3 :- is executed every time after the loop body excuted.


2. For in Loops :- 
	-->	The for in loop iterates over a person object
	-->	Each iteration returns a key (x)
	-->	The key is used to access the value of the key
	-->	The value of the key is person[x]


3. For of Loops :- 
	-->	The JavaScript for of statement loops through the values of an iterable object.

	-->	It lets you loop over iterable data structures such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more:
