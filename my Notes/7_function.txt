	--> Quite often we need to perform a similar action in many places of the script.

	--> For example, we need to show a nice-looking message when a visitor logs in, logs out and maybe somewhere else.

	--> Functions are the main “building blocks” of the program. They allow the code to be called many times without repetition.

E.x :-

	function name(parameter1, parameter2, ... parameterN) {
	 // body
	}
