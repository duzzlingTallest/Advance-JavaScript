	--> Quite often we need to perform a similar action in many places of the script.

	--> For example, we need to show a nice-looking message when a visitor logs in, logs out and maybe somewhere else.

	--> Functions are the main “building blocks” of the program. They allow the code to be called many times without repetition.

E.x :-

	function name(parameter1, parameter2, ... parameterN) {
	 // body
	}


---> What is the --> Object.keys(marks).length  ???
	
	E.x :- 

		let marks = {
		    kaushal: 0,
		    Jay: 100,           //  object // keys
		    Jamiesh: 90 
		}

		console.log(marks);

		for(let i =0;i<Object.keys(marks).length;i++){
    
		}

--> " Object.keys(marks).length " it gives the length and the keys that are inside the object.

--> if i printthis " Object.keys(marks) " all they keys will comes in an ARRAY (ARRAY = Collection of iteams).
